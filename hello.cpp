//This is to print out
#include <iostream>

//This is to use the standard namespace
using namespace std;

//This is the first function all C/C++ programs have to have
int main() {
    cout << "Hello World" << endl; //This prints out to the console
    
    return 0; //I'll talk more about you later.......suspicious.....
